# ONNX Runtime Java API for Android

This directory contains JNI (Java Native Interface) code and Java API of ONNX Runtime

## Getting Started

The Java API is like C++ API and C# API. 

1. Most Java API may throw an OrtException

2. For efficiency, tensor is a [direct byte buffer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html) in Java

3. The native object will be released if the corresponding Java object is released in GC. Besides, Every Java object has a dispose() method that releases the native object manually.

## Build AAR Package

Firstly, build libonnxruntime-jni.so and copy it into the directory of the corresponding architecture (onnxruntime/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a or onnxruntime/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a), then build the AAR Package by running

```bash
./gradlew :onnxruntime:build
```

The Android AAR package will be generated at onnxruntime/build/outputs/aar

## Example

An Android app demo is located in sample
